Update README.md with recent improvements and corrections

Updated README.md to reflect recent features and fixes, including improved
progress tracking, create_overview.sh wrapper, --force-xargs option, and
corrected provider names.

## Changes Made

### 1. Quick Start Section
- Added "Debug Options" subsection
- Documented `--force-xargs` flag for both marking scripts
- Helps users test xargs fallback path

### 2. Generating overview.md Section
- Added `create_overview.sh` shell wrapper (recommended method)
- Updated examples to use wrapper script
- Still mentions Python direct call as alternative

### 3. Progress Tracking Section
**Before (outdated):**
```
[A2/7] [Student 15/42] (35.7%) |███████████░░░░░░░| Processing...
```

**After (accurate):**
- GNU parallel: "Visual progress bar with percentage and ETA"
- xargs: `[ 45%] Completed 100/224 tasks`
- Explains what information is shown
- Notes real-time updates

### 4. Parallel Execution Section
- Added "Execution Methods" subsection
- Documents GNU parallel (recommended)
- Documents xargs (fallback)
- Documents sequential (final fallback)
- Installation instructions for parallel
- Notes both show clear progress tracking

### 5. Provider Names
- Changed "OpenAI/Codex" → "Codex" (line 253)
- Consistent with actual CLI tool name
- Matches rest of documentation

### 6. Example Output Updates
**Step 5 (Marker agents):**
- Old: `[A1/7] [Student 1/5] (2.9%) |█░░░░░░░░░| Processing...`
- New: `[ 14%] Completed 5/35 tasks`

**Step 8 (Unifier agents):**
- Old: `[Student 3/5] (60%) |██████████████░░░| Creating feedback...`
- New: `[ 60%] Completed 3/5 tasks`

**Step 5 detailed example:**
Shows both parallel and xargs output formats:
```
Using GNU parallel for task execution
[=====>                    ] 35% ETA: 2m 15s

# Or with xargs:
Using xargs for task execution
[ 35%] Completed 78/224 tasks
```

### 7. Troubleshooting Section
Added new subsections:

**"xargs: command line cannot be assembled, too long":**
- Notes this has been fixed
- Explains the solution (line numbers instead of command lines)

**"Progress not showing or cryptic messages":**
- Recommends installing GNU parallel
- Shows xargs clear progress format
- Mentions parallel uses `--bar` for clean display

### 8. General Corrections
- Renamed "LLM CLI errors" → "LLM CLI errors or permission issues"
- More accurate section title
- Covers broader troubleshooting scope
