Fix TTY inheritance, prompt template formatting, and file path handling

Fixed "Error: 'i'" by escaping literal braces in prompt templates, ensuring
subprocess calls inherit TTY from parent process, and providing absolute paths
for agent-created files.

Root Cause Analysis:

The cryptic "Error: 'i'" had TWO root causes, plus a file path issue:

1. **Primary**: Prompt template formatting error
   - pattern_designer_structured.md contained `{i}` (lines 57, 88)
   - Python's str.format() tried to substitute `{i}` as a placeholder
   - Raised KeyError('i') when no value provided for 'i'
   - Exception handler printed: "Error: 'i'"

2. **Secondary**: Missing TTY inheritance
   - pattern_designer.py and aggregator.py used subprocess.run(cmd) without TTY
   - Even when run from real terminal, subprocess didn't have TTY access
   - Would have caused "stdout is not a terminal" error once template was fixed

3. **Tertiary**: Relative file paths in prompts
   - Prompts told agent to create files at "processed/rubric.md"
   - Agent created files relative to Codex's working directory
   - Files were created in wrong location, causing rubric validation to fail

Changes Made:

* src/prompts/pattern_designer_structured.md:
  - Line 57, 88: Changed `{i}` to `{{i}}` to escape literal braces
  - Line 88: Changed `processed/activities/A{{i}}_criteria.md` to `{processed_dir}/activities/A{{i}}_criteria.md`
  - Line 92: Changed `processed/rubric.md` to `{processed_dir}/rubric.md`
  - Effect: Template uses absolute paths provided by Python wrapper

* src/prompts/pattern_designer_freeform.md:
  - Line 99: Changed `processed/marking_criteria.md` to `{processed_dir}/marking_criteria.md`
  - Line 103: Changed `processed/rubric.md` to `{processed_dir}/rubric.md`
  - Effect: Template uses absolute paths provided by Python wrapper

* src/agents/pattern_designer.py:
  - Line 92: Added `processed_dir=args.processed_dir` to format() call
  - Line 131: Added `stdin=sys.stdin, stdout=sys.stdout, stderr=sys.stderr` to subprocess.run()
  - Effect: Passes absolute processed directory path to template and inherits TTY

* src/agents/aggregator.py:
  - Line 157: Added `stdin=sys.stdin, stdout=sys.stdout, stderr=sys.stderr` to subprocess.run()
  - Effect: Interactive CLI inherits parent's TTY for proper terminal access

* src/llm_caller.sh:
  - Claude: Replaced script with tee for session capture (works in all contexts)
  - Gemini: Replaced script with tee for session capture (works in all contexts)
  - Codex: Special handling to preserve TTY access without piping
    • Interactive mode: Runs directly without output capture
    • Saves only session start/end timestamps
    • Allows TTY passthrough for interactive use

* README.md:
  - Added note about Codex TTY requirements
  - Documented limitations for interactive vs headless modes
  - Added blank lines around lists for markdown linting

Python String Formatting Gotcha:

When using str.format() or f-strings, literal braces must be doubled:
- `"A{i}"` → tries to substitute variable `i`
- `"A{{i}}"` → renders as literal `A{i}`

This affects:
- Template strings with placeholders AND literal braces
- Format strings that need to output curly braces
- Any code using .format() or f-strings with mixed content

File Path Best Practices:

When instructing LLM agents to create files:
- ✓ Use absolute paths: `/full/path/to/file.md`
- ✗ Use relative paths: `processed/file.md`

Relative paths are resolved from agent's current working directory, which may be:
- User's home directory
- System temp directory
- LLM CLI's installation directory
- Anywhere else depending on how the CLI was invoked

Absolute paths ensure files are created in the correct location regardless of
the agent's working directory.

How subprocess TTY Inheritance Works:

By default, subprocess.run(cmd) creates new pipes for stdin/stdout/stderr:
- Parent's TTY: /dev/ttys001 (or similar)
- Subprocess stdin: pipe (not a TTY)
- Subprocess stdout: pipe (not a TTY)
- Result: isatty() returns False in subprocess

With stdin=sys.stdin, stdout=sys.stdout, stderr=sys.stderr:
- Parent's TTY: /dev/ttys001
- Subprocess stdin: /dev/ttys001 (inherited)
- Subprocess stdout: /dev/ttys001 (inherited)
- Result: isatty() returns True in subprocess

This allows interactive CLIs (Codex, Claude, Gemini) to:
- Detect they're running in a terminal
- Enable interactive features (prompts, colors, etc.)
- Properly handle user input

Agent Types and TTY Requirements:

Interactive Agents (need TTY):
- Pattern Designer: Creates rubric and marking criteria with instructor
- Aggregator: Compiles final grades and statistics
- Now properly inherit TTY from parent terminal

Headless Agents (don't need TTY):
- Marker: Evaluates student work (uses capture_output=True)
- Normalizer: Aggregates assessments (uses capture_output=True)
- Unifier: Applies final scheme (uses capture_output=True)
- Already working correctly with output capture

Testing:

Before fix:
✗ ./mark_structured.sh → "Error: 'i'" from KeyError in template formatting
✗ Even after template fix → "Error: stdout is not a terminal"
✗ Even after TTY fix → Files created in wrong directory, rubric validation fails
✗ subprocess.run() didn't have TTY access

After fix:
✓ ./mark_structured.sh → Pattern Designer launches interactively
✓ Template renders correctly with A{i} literal braces
✓ Codex detects TTY and runs in interactive mode
✓ Files created at correct absolute paths
✓ Rubric validation succeeds
✓ Claude and Gemini work with tee-based session capture
✓ All headless agents continue working with output capture

Provider-Specific Behavior:

Claude Code CLI:
- Interactive: Accepts piped input via stdin
- Session capture: Full capture via tee
- TTY requirement: Not strict (works with or without)

Gemini CLI:
- Interactive: Accepts piped input via stdin
- Session capture: Full capture via tee
- TTY requirement: Not strict (works with or without)

Codex CLI:
- Interactive: Requires real TTY (strict isatty() check)
- Session capture: Limited to timestamps only
- TTY requirement: Strict (fails without TTY)

User Impact:

Before: Users saw cryptic "Error: 'i'" when trying to run marking workflow
After: Users can successfully run interactive agents and files are created correctly

The fix ensures that:
1. Prompt templates format correctly without KeyError
2. When instructors run ./mark_structured.sh from terminal, it works
3. Interactive agents can properly interact with the user
4. Files are created at the correct absolute paths
5. Rubric validation succeeds after pattern design
6. Session logs are captured (fully for Claude/Gemini, timestamps for Codex)
7. Headless agents continue working in parallel execution
