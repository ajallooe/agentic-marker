Improve progress messages for parallel and xargs execution

Replaced cryptic GNU parallel progress messages with a clear progress bar, and
added real-time progress tracking for xargs with percentage and task counts.

## Problem

**GNU parallel** was displaying cryptic messages like:
```
local:4/64/100%/6.3s
```

Which meant:
- `local` - hostname
- `4` - jobs running currently
- `64` - jobs completed
- `100%` - percentage complete
- `6.3s` - time elapsed

**xargs** had no progress tracking at all, making it impossible to see how many
tasks were completed during long-running operations with hundreds of tasks.

## Solution

### GNU Parallel

Replaced `--progress` flag with `--bar` for cleaner visual progress display:

**Before:**
```
local:4/64/100%/6.3s
```

**After:**
```
[Progress bar display with ETA]
```

The `--bar` option provides a standard progress bar with clear percentage and
time estimates.

### xargs

Added custom progress tracking with atomic file locking:

**Display format:**
```
[  0%] Completed 0/224 tasks
[ 12%] Completed 28/224 tasks
[ 45%] Completed 100/224 tasks
[100%] Completed 224/224 tasks
```

**Implementation:**
- Directory-based locking using `mkdir` (atomic on all Unix systems)
- Portable across macOS and Linux (no flock dependency)
- Updates in real-time as tasks complete
- Progress shown on stderr to avoid mixing with task output
- ANSI escape codes clear line before each update

## Implementation Details

**src/parallel_runner.sh:**

1. **GNU parallel section:**
   - Changed from `--progress` to `--bar`
   - Filter out any remaining cryptic messages with `grep -v '^parallel:'`
   - Capture exit code properly with `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`

2. **xargs section:**
   - Created temporary directory for progress tracking files
   - `update_progress()` function with atomic directory-based locking
   - Wrapper function `task_with_progress()` that:
     - Executes task via `execute_task_by_line()`
     - Updates progress counter atomically
     - Displays formatted progress to stderr
   - Initial progress display showing 0%
   - Final newline to preserve last progress message

3. **Locking mechanism:**
   - Uses `mkdir` for atomic lock acquisition (portable)
   - Retry loop with 100 attempts and 0.01s sleep
   - Skips update if lock can't be acquired (graceful degradation)
   - Releases lock with `rmdir` after update
   - No dependency on flock/lockfile commands

4. **Display format:**
   - `\r` - carriage return to beginning of line
   - `\033[K` - ANSI escape to clear from cursor to end of line
   - `[%3d%%]` - percentage with padding
   - `Completed %d/%d tasks` - current/total count
   - Output to stderr (`>&2`) to separate from task stdout

## Testing

✓ **GNU parallel** with `--bar` (cleaner progress bar)
✓ **xargs** shows real-time progress: `[  0%] Completed 0/5 tasks`
✓ **Progress updates** atomically without race conditions
✓ **Directory locking** works on macOS (no flock needed)
✓ **5 tasks** complete successfully with progress tracking
✓ **ANSI codes** work in real terminals (clear line updates)
✓ **Final message** preserved with newline

**Example output (xargs):**
```
Using xargs for task execution (forced via --force-xargs)

[  0%] Completed 0/5 tasks
[ 40%] Completed 2/5 tasks
[ 80%] Completed 4/5 tasks
[100%] Completed 5/5 tasks

====================
✓ All 5 tasks completed successfully
```

## Files Changed

- **src/parallel_runner.sh**:
  - GNU parallel: Changed to `--bar`, filter messages, fix exit code
  - xargs: Added progress tracking with atomic locking
  - Created `update_progress()` and `task_with_progress()` functions
  - Export variables for progress tracking
  - Clean up temp directory on completion

- **dev/COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt**: Updated (this commit)

## Benefits

**User Experience:**
- **Clear progress**: See exactly how many tasks completed out of total
- **Percentage**: Quick visual indication of overall progress
- **Consistency**: Both parallel and xargs now show progress
- **Professional**: No more cryptic messages

**Technical:**
- **Portable**: Works on macOS and Linux without external dependencies
- **Atomic**: Directory-based locking prevents race conditions
- **Robust**: Graceful degradation if lock can't be acquired
- **Efficient**: Minimal overhead per task completion

**For large assignments:**
With 224 tasks (7 activities × 32 students), users can now see:
```
[ 45%] Completed 100/224 tasks
```

Instead of wondering if the process is still running.

This improvement makes long-running marking workflows much more transparent and
gives users confidence that the system is making progress.
