Fix LLM caller to properly support all three CLI providers

Corrected the unified LLM caller (src/llm_caller.sh) to properly invoke
Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI with the correct command-line
interfaces for both interactive and headless modes.

Changes to src/llm_caller.sh:

* Claude Code CLI (claude command):
  - Interactive mode: Use stdin to provide initial prompt (echo "$prompt" | claude)
  - Headless mode: Use --print flag (claude --print "$prompt")
  - Session capture: script command wraps interactive sessions

* Gemini CLI (gemini command):
  - Interactive mode: Use stdin to provide initial prompt (echo "$prompt" | gemini)
  - Headless mode: Use positional argument (gemini "$prompt")
  - Session capture: script command wraps interactive sessions
  - Note: Avoid --prompt-interactive flag due to stdin conflicts

* Codex CLI (codex command, NOT openai):
  - Interactive mode: Pass prompt as argument (codex "$prompt")
  - Headless mode: Use exec subcommand (codex exec "$prompt")
  - Session capture: script command wraps interactive sessions
  - Requires TTY for interactive mode (provided by script)
  - Model specified via -c flag (codex -c model=gpt-5.1)

* Provider routing:
  - Fixed function name: call_openai → call_codex
  - Proper command detection: uses codex command, not openai
  - Model inference: gpt-* models map to codex provider

Changes to README.md:

* Updated LLM provider documentation section:
  - Clarified that OpenAI provider uses 'codex' command
  - Added verification section with test commands for each provider
  - Updated prerequisites to mention all three CLI tools

* Added troubleshooting section for LLM CLI errors:
  - How to verify CLI tools are installed
  - How to test each provider directly
  - Specific guidance for Codex vs OpenAI naming confusion

* Examples of testing each provider:
  - Claude: claude --print "test"
  - Gemini: gemini "test"
  - Codex: codex exec "test"

Testing:

All three providers verified working in both modes:
- ✓ Claude headless: claude --print
- ✓ Gemini headless: gemini positional argument
- ✓ Codex headless: codex exec
- ✓ Interactive modes use appropriate TTY/stdin techniques

Root Cause:

The original error "Error: 'i'" occurred because:
1. Assignment configured with provider: codex, model: gpt-5.1
2. llm_caller.sh attempted to call 'openai' command (doesn't exist)
3. System only has 'codex' CLI installed at /opt/homebrew/bin/codex
4. Wrong command name caused cryptic error during invocation

This fix ensures the marking system works with any of the three supported
LLM providers (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Codex CLI) as configured in
the assignment's overview.md file.
