Add resume capability and update README documentation

Implemented comprehensive resume functionality for both marking scripts, allowing
workflows to continue from where they left off after errors or interruptions.
Updated README with detailed documentation of resume options.

## Changes Made

### 1. Resume Capability Implementation

**Both mark_structured.sh and mark_freeform.sh:**

Added three operational modes:
- **Resume (default)**: Automatically skips completed stages and tasks
- **`--no-resume`**: Regenerate from scratch, ignoring existing outputs
- **`--clean`**: Remove entire processed/ directory and start fresh

**Stage-by-stage resume logic:**
- Stage 1: Skip if submissions_manifest.json exists
- Stage 2: Skip if activities.json (structured) or rubric/criteria (freeform) exist
- Stage 3/4: Skip marker tasks where output .md file exists
- Stage 5: Skip normalizer if scoring files exist
- Stage 6: Skip dashboard if approved_scheme.json exists
- Stage 7: Skip unifier tasks where feedback .md files exist
- Stage 8: Skip aggregator if grades.csv exists

**Smart progress reporting:**
```bash
# Shows how many tasks were skipped vs. need to run
Generated 28 marker tasks (skipped 196 already completed)
All 224 marker tasks already completed
```

**Example recovery workflow:**
```bash
# First run - 196/224 tasks complete before error
./mark_structured.sh assignments/lab1

# Second run - automatically processes only the 28 failed tasks
./mark_structured.sh assignments/lab1
# Output: "Generated 28 marker tasks (skipped 196 already completed)"
```

### 2. README.md Updates

**Added "Resume Options" section:**
- Explains default resume behavior
- Documents all three operational modes
- Lists what gets preserved during resume
- Provides guidance on when to use each mode
- Includes practical recovery example

**Content:**
- What gets preserved (completed stages, tasks, schemes)
- When to use each option (error recovery, regeneration, clean start)
- Example showing 196/224 tasks preserved, 28 re-run

### 3. Implementation Details

**mark_structured.sh changes:**
- Added `RESUME=true` (default), `--no-resume`, `--clean` argument parsing
- Added resume checks before each stage
- Modified marker task generation to check for existing output files
- Modified unifier task generation to check for existing feedback files
- Added skip counts and reporting
- Conditional execution: only run parallel_runner if tasks exist

**mark_freeform.sh changes:**
- Same resume logic adapted for freeform workflow
- Checks rubric.md and marking_criteria.md for Stage 2
- Single scoring.md for Stage 4 (no per-activity)
- Otherwise identical pattern to structured

### 4. Error Handling Improvements

**Graceful failure recovery:**
- Tasks can fail without losing completed work
- Re-running script only processes failed tasks
- No need to manually track what completed
- Preserves all successfully generated artifacts

**Use cases:**
- LLM API rate limiting (5-hour limits, daily quotas)
- Network interruptions
- Individual task failures (malformed notebooks)
- User interruption (Ctrl+C)
- System crashes or reboots

## Why These Changes Matter

**Efficiency:**
- Saves hours of redundant LLM processing
- No need to wait for already-completed work to re-run
- Critical for large assignments (224+ tasks)

**Reliability:**
- Graceful handling of partial failures
- Can interrupt and resume anytime
- Robust against transient errors

**Cost savings:**
- Avoid re-running expensive LLM calls
- Particularly important with paid API tiers
- Matters for rate-limited free tiers

**User experience:**
- Clear feedback on what's being skipped
- Progress preserved across sessions
- Less frustration from errors

## Common Use Case Example

**Scenario:** Codex hits 5-hour usage limit at 53% completion (119/224 tasks)

**Before resume capability:**
- User must wait for limit reset
- User must manually track completed students/activities
- Re-running script processes all 224 tasks again
- Wastes API quota on already-completed work

**After resume capability:**
```bash
# Wait for limit reset at 3am
# Then simply re-run same command
./mark_structured.sh assignments/lab1

# Output:
# [INFO] Resume mode: Will skip completed stages and tasks
# [INFO] Stage 1: Skipping (submissions manifest already exists)
# [INFO] Stage 2: Skipping (activities already extracted)
# [INFO] Stage 3: Skipping (rubric and marking criteria already exist)
# [INFO] Generated 105 marker tasks (skipped 119 already completed)
# [ 47%] Completed 50/105 tasks
```

## Files Changed

- **mark_structured.sh**:
  - Argument parsing: Added `RESUME`, `--no-resume`, `--clean`
  - All stages: Added resume checks
  - Stage 4 (Marker): Task generation skips existing outputs
  - Stage 7 (Unifier): Task generation skips existing outputs
  - Progress reporting: Shows skipped vs. running counts
  - Conditional execution: Only run parallel_runner if tasks > 0

- **mark_freeform.sh**:
  - Same changes adapted for freeform workflow
  - Stage 2: Check both rubric.md and marking_criteria.md
  - Stage 4: Single scoring.md check

- **README.md**:
  - Added "Resume Options" section after "Debug Options"
  - Documents default behavior, --no-resume, --clean
  - Explains what gets preserved
  - Provides usage guidance and recovery example

## Testing

Verified resume functionality:
✓ Skips completed stages correctly
✓ Counts and reports skipped tasks accurately
✓ Only generates tasks for missing outputs
✓ --clean removes processed/ directory
✓ --no-resume regenerates everything
✓ Progress messages show skip counts
✓ Works after LLM rate limit errors
✓ Works after partial completion (119/224 done)

Resume capability now fully operational for both structured and freeform assignments.
